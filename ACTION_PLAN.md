### **2. 📱 Mobile Responsive Design**
**Current Status:** Desktop-optimized, works on mobile but not optimized
**What Needs:** Mobile-first optimization for all pages
**Estimated Time:** 3-4 days
**Priority:** HIGH

**Pages to Optimize:**
```
Frontend pages to test/fix at 320px, 375px, 414px widths:
- Dashboard
- Transactions (list, add, edit)
- Budgets (list, add, edit, settings)
- Categories (list, add, edit)
- Reports (monthly, yearly, category)
- Analytics
- Profile
- Admin pages (if accessible on mobile)
```

**Key Requirements:**
- Touch targets minimum 44x44px
- Readable text without zooming
- No horizontal scrolling
- Mobile-friendly forms (large inputs, dropdowns)
- Bottom margin for mobile keyboards
- Hamburger menu for navigation (optional)

**Steps:**
1. Install Chrome DevTools Device Mode
2. Test each page at 320px width (iPhone SE)
3. Fix layout issues (use Tailwind responsive classes)
4. Test forms on touch device
5. Add `<meta name="viewport">` if missing
6. Test on real mobile device

**Why Critical:** 60%+ of users may access on mobile
